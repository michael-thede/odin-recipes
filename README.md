# odin-recipes
Repository for the first official TOP project.

In this project, I will create a basic website that will link to a 
few different recipes. This will show that I know how to do basic 
things like adding paragraphs/headers, provide descriptive titles,
include images, and make working links while also preserving 
readability.
